# Windows Logging for SOC – Incident Analysis Project

## Overview
This project documents my hands-on work with Windows event logs and Sysmon to analyze security incidents in a SOC (Security Operations Center) environment. Using Event Viewer and provided log files, I investigated authentication events, user management activity, malware execution, and network connections.

## Objectives
- Understand Windows Security and Sysmon logs
- Identify brute-force and RDP attacks
- Track malicious user activity
- Analyze malware execution and persistence
- Correlate events to build an attack timeline

## Tools Used
- Windows Event Viewer
- Sysmon
- Practice EVTX Log Files
- TryHackMe Virtual Machine

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Log analysis and filtering
- Incident investigation
- Threat detection
- Event correlation
- Documentation and reporting

## Outcome
By completing this project, I gained practical experience in analyzing Windows logs to detect attacks, investigate compromised accounts, and trace malware activity in a SOC environment.

This project demonstrates my ability to perform entry-level SOC investigations using real-world logging tools.
